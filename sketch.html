<h1>Sketch for UX Design</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Prior to my deeper dive in the world of UX, I had never heard of Sketch, but whenever I searched up more information of the role of a UXD, Sketch was one of the listed platforms commonly used. Luckily, following the LinkedIn’s Learning Path “Become a User Experience Designer “one of the courses, “Sketch for UX Design,” centered around this widely used platforms.</p>

<h4>Role</h4>
<p>Independent Learner</p>

<h4>Methods & Tools</h4>

	<ul style="list-style-type:none;  padding-left: 0;">
		<li>Sketch</li>
		<li>LinkedIn Learning</li>
	</ul>  

<h4>Practices</h4>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;  padding-left: 0;">
		<li>UX & UI Design</li>
		<li>Wireframing</li>
		<li>Prototyping</li>
	</ul>  

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>One of the major problems I faced before being able to even complete this course was the lack of a Mac! I only own a Windows devices, resulting me being in a bit of a pickle. However, I was eventually able to borrow a mac, which resulted in my next problem! Readjusting to it! It's been a long while since I used a Mac, but I was quickly able to adapt. Outside of that little conundrum I had, I learned a great deal from this course. Sketch is an easy tool to use, but with more involvement, becomes extremely powerful. I can now comfortably say, I have a good understanding of how to use Sketch what I could use it for, and what type of projects can be created on it. </p>
