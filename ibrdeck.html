<h1>Internal Business Review</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>At the beginning of each month, the finance department leads the creation of an Internal Business Review. The team pulls together several data points from the company, stemming across multiple dashboards published on our Tableau Server. To combat having to pull from different sources across the server, and to create a platform that could become more passible to potential future members of the team, I created a single hub in which the high level data points that would be presented to the business could be pulled, reducing the time spent hunting down each unique number and view needed in order to produce the presentation for the business.</p>

<h4>Methods & Tools</h4>

<h4>Practices</h4>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;  padding-left: 0;">
		<li>Prototyping</li>
		<li>Usability Testing</li>
	</ul>  

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>The beginning stages of this project called for regular communication with the team to understand the wants and needs. I went through a few concepts and ideas for each view that needed to be created and made sure that the primary users were aware of how to use each view. The Finance team now has a regularly updated location on the companies Tableau Server which holds all the data they need in order to create the businesses review presentation. This also allows them to see the data live now, if needed, as well as include any new views if needed. </p>
