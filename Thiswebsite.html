<h1>This Website</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>My first website was, not the best… However, I took what I learned from that experience, expanded on it a bit more and created the very website you are on now! Completely starting from the ground up, I sketched out what exactly I wanted this website to look like with a pen and paper. I wanted something more presentable, mobile friendly, and functionable. I went through several sheets as I continued to have more ideas on what I wanted everything to look like. There was certainly more learning that needed to be done with some of the more complex concepts I had, but overall, I am significantly happier with this attempt than my last. </p>

<h4>Role</h4>
<p>Developer</p>

<h4>Methods & Tools</h4>

	<ul style="list-style-type:none;  padding-left: 0;">
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Javascript</li>
		<li> Low Fidelity Wireframing</li>
	</ul>  

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>Spending more time on this site than the first and having a better understanding of web development, I was able to achieve a website that met all my requirements such as being more responsive and presentable. Big upgrades from my first attempt now include having a navigation bar that takes you somewhere besides the main page, and having a nicer footer which includes a little more about myself. There isn’t necessarily a time frame or end date for this project’s completion, as I plan to keep evolving it and apply anything else I learn that can make this a more pleasant experience overall. I hope to continue learning and growing, so that this website can become something even more awesome!</p>
